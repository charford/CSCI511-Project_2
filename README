SiteDiagramGUI                                                 By Casey Harford
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Overall, I felt this project went well. Although I ran into issues along the
way, it all came together in the end. The parts that were easy, seemed to be
the back end. The model, which tracks objects, the build space, etc. This is
the part of the project which came easy for me.

  The part of the project that caused the most difficulties came when it was 
time to "paint" some objects. I was making a small problme, more complicated
than it needed to be. I had already got it to the point where a user could
click a space on the board, and return a set of coordinates to place the
object. The problem was actually drawing the object, and keeping it on the
game board.

  The solution was using an arraylist of objects which tracked objects that
had already been built. From there, I just added a loop in the paint method
for SiteDiagramGUI, which checks the arraylist for objects already built. 
Then, I used the repaint() method after each object was "built" to make it 
appear on the game board.

  The other major issue I had was meeting the requirement of having a 
SiteDeveloper class, which instantiates SiteDiagramGUI. It just did not make
sense to me, and I felt the way I did it made more sense, and functionally,
worked fine. With any programming language, it seems there's always several
ways to do something, with none of them necessarily being the "correct" or
"better" way.

  In the end, I learned a lot about Java, and also realized that I do not want
to have a career programming Java. I'll stick with Ruby On Rails.
